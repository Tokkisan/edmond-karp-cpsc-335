Edmonds-Karp algorithm is used to find the maximum flow of a graph, one key difference between this algorithm 
and Ford's is this one uses a bfs approach while Ford uses a DFS approach. 


The datastructures used in EdmondsKarp algorithm are:

lists/arrays: ordered set of elmenets and used in
-> parent: storing parent node for bfs
-> visited: storing nodes that have been visited 

adacency matrix: a matrix that is used to represent a graph but with lists or arrays

queue: First In First Out, used in the bfs to keep track of the nodes visited
